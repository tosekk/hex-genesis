# Economy v2 balance report

## Selected final balance — N3 round 4

Real GameSession, 20×14, seeds 1–20, 97407 ms for both bots. No demolition, reshuffle, resource weighting, or lookahead. Offers favor a new mixed biome at the best legal site, then the less represented main biome. Core sites maximize dead placeable claims, tied by HexId. Combo ties favor partial hexes.

All-seed medians treat unreached thresholds as infinity. Parenthesized ranges and reached-only medians include completers only; missing runs are never silently excluded from target checks. Ratios require finite all-seed medians for both bots. T6 fill is measured at the threshold transaction before the new core is deployed. No T6 completers makes the fill target unmeasurable, not a success.

## Calibration selection

Six rounds completed. Round 4 is retained by priority 4 > 2 > 1 > 3. It passes reachability and combo advantage; T2–T6 pacing passes individually. T1 remains early (2 vs 5.6–8.4), and four spam seeds reach T6 before 70% fill. Round 5 loses the finite spam T6 median; round 6 loses reachability. See `tasks/status/astra.md` for every value change and guardrail decision; `baseline.json` and `round-1.json` … `round-6.json` preserve full reproducible evidence. These measurements do not prove all possible allowed configurations impossible.
